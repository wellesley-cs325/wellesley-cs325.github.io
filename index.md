# Welcome to CS 325!

**Description:** In this course, students will learn how to design interventions for people with diverse abilities. Students will encounter models of disability, accessible design frameworks, participant-led research methodologies, and common assistive technologies through readings and hands-on activities. Students will form teams and work to address and design a solution for a real-world accessibility need.

**Prerequisites:** CS 220 or appropriate self-study.

**Meeting Times:** Tuesdays and Fridays, 2:10-3:25pm

**Meeting Location:** Science Center L Wing 120 (HCI Lab).

**Office Hours:** TBD in Science Center L Wing 121 (across from the HCI Lab).

# Course Overview

**Goals** 
Over the semester, we will cover a range of research, disability, and assistive technology topics. We will engage with these topics in a variety of ways, including reading and presenting research papers, in-class discussions, activity labs, and a semester-long group project. At the end of the semester, you should be able to: 

* Define common models of disability and distinct perspectives on what it means for a system to be "accessible."
* Apply principles of disability justice to your design thinking.
* Apply principles of co-design and participatory action research to your design thinking.
* Discuss a variety of Accessibility Technologies (AT) and who uses them.
* Describe Inclusive Design and how it differs from other User-Centered Design methods.
* List and incorporate important considerations for recruiting and working with participants with disabilities in UX research.
* Consider intersectional participant identities and how your positionality/identity impacts you and your research.
* Work with a variety of prototyping methods, both digital and physical.
* Conduct a case study by enacting iterative interviews, co-design sessions, and formal user evaluation. 
* Write a clear extended abstract. 
* Create and carry out an accessible presentation. 
* Read, analyze, synthesize, and discuss academic research papers.

**Materials**

All readings will be available online and/or linked to the course schedule as PDFs. For presentations, we will be working on shared Google slide decks, so students will need a Google account to access and edit (your Wellesley email should work for this purpose). 
For design, I suggest (1) dotted or grid paper and (2) drawing/writing materials. I personally use [this notebook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZXHFVNW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_11?smid=A2LB5I1U16RCD4&psc=1) and [these pencils](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQJYNW2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_10?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1), but you can use anything you like.

**Assignments and Evaluation**

**Participation: 20%**
At the 300 level, class is less about lectures and more about discussion, engagement, and hands-on learning. Therefore, attendance, timeliness, focus, and engagement are a significant portion of your evaluation and grade.

**Research Presentations: 10%**
During the semester, we will have two weeks dedicated to research presentations and discussions. Each student will present once and facilitate a discussion after the presentation. This is how we will often engage with research papers and course content topics.

**Group Project: 70%**
You will embark on a semester-long group project that will incorporate the skills and content we learn through the course. 

* P1 - Participant interview notes (5%)
* P2 - Ideation and project proposal (10%)
* P3 - Iterative design sketches (5%)
* P4 - Early feedback notes (5%)
* P5 - Prototype (15%)
* P6 - User Evaluation (10%)
* P7 - Final project write-up (10%)
* Final research presentation (10%)

**Grading Policy:** There is no arbitrary limit on the number of As, Bs, Cs, etc. for the class. Every student will be assigned the grade they earn and deserve according to the rubric for each assignment. 

The mapping from numerical score to letter grades looks like this in CS325:

A: 95%+

A-: 90-94.99%

B+: 86-89.99%

B: 83-85.99%

B-: 80-82.99%

C+: 76-79.99%

C: 73-75.99%

C-: 70-72.99%

D: 60-69.99%

F: 0-59.99%

# Course Expectations

In class, we will collaboratively create together a list of shared expectations for yourself, your peers, and your instructor.

**Project Groups**

Students will possess unique skill sets and likely work on distinct tasks, but all are expected to contribute "equally." This includes actively participating in group discussions, sharing ideas, and dividing work fairly. You should respect the opinions and ideas of your peers, and be open to constructive criticism. Communication is key, so you should keep everyone in the loop about their progress and any challenges you might be facing. Additionally, you should meet deadlines set by the group. 
I will provide time in class for group project work, but I expect you to meet with your group regularly outside of class to work on the project. Ultimately, the goal of a group project is not only to produce high-quality output but also to learn from each other and develop teamwork and collaboration skills.

**Collaboration Policy**

The [Wellesley College honor code](https://www.wellesley.edu/studentlife/aboutus/honor/procedures) applies to CS325. 

This course emphasizes collaboration, as working effectively within teams is an important part of innovation culture. I strongly encourage you to get to know all of your classmates (and me!) and to collaborate extensively with them during the group project and any in-class exercises. 

Research presentations are individually assessed and should be developed without any collaboration. 

**Use of Generative AI to Complete Assignments**

Unless explicitly permitted by me on an assignment-by-assignment basis, the use of any generative artificial intelligence tools is prohibited in CS325. This course often depends on personal reflection and insight. Donâ€™t outsource your growth. While I am absolutely not against generative AI tools, and acknowledge they could be helpful in future professional research and design work, they do not have a place in CS325. The use of a generative AI tool, unless explicitly permitted by an assignment description, will be considered an [Honor Code Violation](https://www.wellesley.edu/about-us/policies-procedures/honor-code).

# Student Resources

**Accessibility**

As an accessibility researcher teaching an accessibility course, I take student accessibility very seriously. I will make every effort possible to accommodate student needs and feedback. To support students, I am implementing the following:

* A 48-hour grace period for project milestone submissions.
* No quizzes or exams.
* Multiple in-class project work days. 
* Any lecture slides will be accessible (e.g. with alt text, standard layouts, and plain language) and posted before class.
* A variety of learning methods.

If you have a disability or any circumstance, either long-term or temporary, and need reasonable academic adjustments in this course, please contact [Accessibility and Disability Resources](https://www1.wellesley.edu/adr) (ADR) as soon as possible. You should [request accommodations](https://www1.wellesley.edu/adr/register) as early as possible in the semester or before the semester begins. If you need immediate assistance or accommodation before your request is completed, please arrange to meet with me as soon as possible. We can create a plan together. If you are unsure but suspect you may have an undocumented need for accommodations, ADR can assist with screening and referrals for assessments. 
Accessibility and Disability Resources can be reached at [accessibility@wellesley.edu](mailto:accessibility@wellesley.edu) or by phone at 781-283-1300. For more information, go to [https://www1.wellesley.edu/adr](https://www1.wellesley.edu/adr).

**Support and Inclusion**

During the semester, there may be experiences outside of your control that impact your learning or your class performance. You have lives outside of this course, and this class takes place in challenging times. Please reach out to me if you are having a difficult time with this class, or in general.

My intention as an educator is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all learners. I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. I intend that the diversity you bring to our class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I am committed and eager to learn from you this semester.
