# Welcome to CS 325!

**Description:** In this course, students will learn how to design interventions for people with diverse abilities. Students will encounter models of disability, accessible design frameworks, participant-led research methodologies, and common assistive technologies through readings and hands-on activities. Students will form teams and work to address and design a solution for a real-world accessibility need.

**Prerequisites:** CS 220 or appropriate self-study.

**Meeting Times:**
* Class: Tuesdays and Fridays, 2:10-3:25pm

**Meeting Location:** Science Center L Wing 120 (HCI Lab).

**Office Hours:** TBD in Science Center L Wing 121 (across from the HCI Lab).

<br/>

# Course Overview

**Goals** 
Over the semester, we will cover a range of research, disability, and assistive technology topics. We will engage with these topics in a variety of ways, including reading and presenting research papers, in-class discussions, activity labs, and a semester-long group project. At the end of the semester, you should be able to: 

* Define common models of disability and distinct perspectives on what it means for a system to be "accessible."
* Apply principles of disability justice to your design thinking.
* Apply principles of co-design and participatory action research to your design thinking.
* Discuss a variety of Accessibility Technologies (AT) and who uses them.
* Describe Inclusive Design and how it differs from other User-Centered Design methods.
* List and incorporate important considerations for recruiting and working with participants with disabilities in UX research.
* Consider intersectional participant identities and how your positionality/identity impacts you and your research.
* Work with a variety of prototyping methods, both digital and physical.
* Conduct a case study by enacting iterative interviews, co-design sessions, and formal user evaluation. 
* Write a clear extended abstract. 
* Create and carry out an accessible presentation. 
* Read, analyze, synthesize, and discuss academic research papers.

<br/>

# Learning Goals

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Identify abstract data types and fundamental algorithms and summarize their typical uses, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Use, implement, and modify various data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables and graphs.
* Understand tradeoffs between different implementations of an abstract data type.
* Analyze runtime efficiency of searching and sorting algorithms and abstract data type operations.
* Solve substantial computational problems by using the Java programming language, object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms.  
* Work with a team to design, implement and test computer programs.

# How to Succeed in CS230

We want you to succeed, and we will do all we can to help you learn the material and become a strong programmer. From your side, here are a few things you can do to succeed in this course:

* Programming is hard: Try not to blame yourself for your mistakes; give yourself more time, and ask for help when needed.
* Programming is a skill: The best programmer has made every mistake in the books!
* Set aside time in your calendar to work on the material throughout the week. Some weeks you might have to spend well over 12h.
* When working on course materials, turn off your social media.
* Attend all lectures, quit all social media while in class.
* Attend all labs, quit all social media while in class.
* Treat labs as an opportunity to engage your curiosity, delve deeply into topics introduced in class, practice asking and answering questions.
* Read the book twice a week.
* Review the relevant book chapters, slides, and lab exercises BEFORE attempting to do the homework.
* Read homework description immediately (Friday or Saturday at the latest).
* Start working on the problem set as early as possible, and work on it a little bit every day, rather than trying to finish 1-2 days before it's due.
* Start homework early, be prepared to make mistakes. That's how you learn a skill!



<br/>

# Equipment and Materials

**Computers.** All programming in CS230 will be done using BlueJ. If you want, you can use your own computer but you will have to maintain the software, and be prepared to use the department's machines if yours has problems. Unfortunately, the course instructors will not be able to help you trouble-shoot your own computer.

**Course Discussion.** This semester we will be using Courselore for CS230 for class discussion. If you have registered in the course, you will receive an email about joining after the first day of classes. Please do that. The system is highly catered to getting you help from classmates, the TAs, and the instructors. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Courselore at the appropriate tag. We will use Courselore for several purposes. We will use it to make class announcements, such as corrections to assignments and clarifications of material discussed in class. We encourage you to post questions or comments that are of interest to students in the course. Please do not post significant amounts of Java code (i.e. more than one or two lines of code) in your messages on the group! The instructors and TAs will read messages posted in the group on a daily basis and post answers to questions found there. Please note that Courselore is mainly a tool for you to interact with your peers. Answering questions is one of the best ways to learn something, so try to answer each other's questions. Also, as a reminder, there are no such things as stupid questions, and the act of formulating your question carefully is also an important part of the learning process. Writing is thinking. So please don't be shy to ask any question that might pop up. To encourage this, please make sure that your questions are public to your peers as well as your instructors. **You are also encouraged to use Courselore to find people to join a study group.** Please plan to check Courselore on a daily basis.


**Reading.** It is expected that you read the relevant sections of the textbook and the class notes twice a week. It is a must that you do that before you start your assignments because they will seem much easier to complete then!
* **Textbook:** Regular readings will be assigned from the required text, Java Foundations, by Lewis, DePasquale and Chase. We will be using the 2nd edition though if you have access to a newer edition is fine. We recommend you buy your own copy because it can be useful for your future reference as well.
* **Class Notes:** In the syllabus, each lecture is linked to class slides. If you would like to use them to keep notes feel free to print them before class or just download them on your device. Please note that the slides linked on the syllabus are not intended to be fully-fledged notes for each class. They are starting slides that you can expand on during class, when you take your own notes (as such, some of the slides might contain blanks).

**Java Documentation.** Being able to understand and use the official Java Documentation is a characteristic of every successful programmer. Become familiar with it!



<br/>

# Course Requirements

**Lectures.** There are two 75-minute lectures each week that will introduce the main content of the course.

**Labs.** Every student is required to complete and submit the weekly lab practice. Lab work will include exercises to review and reinforce the lecture material and to develop general programming, testing and debugging skills. The labs will also provide further opportunity to ask questions about course material.

**Attending one 110-minute lab each week is a requirement for all students.** In labs you will be working either with a partner, or individually. In general, note that some labs might contain more tasks than can reasonably be done in the available class time. This is on purpose! Labs are not a race to the finish, but are your opportunity to practice and explore the material together with your partner. Solutions to lab exercises will be provided at the end of Thursday; you are encouraged to study these solutions. At the end of the day of your lab, each student is **required** to submit on Gradescope whatever lab work they have worked on until then. For some labs you might have to submit other components, either before lab begins or after lab ends. These will be labeled on the calendar, no later than the Monday prior to the respective lab. You are expected to check the calendar regularly to make sure you submit what is necessary on time.

**Tutors.** CS 230 is fortunate enough to have a number of excellent peer tutors: students who have taken CS 230 in the past and want to help others to succeed. They each hold café (drop-in) hours for two hours each week, and they are also available for one-on-one tutoring. Here are some norms you should remember:
* They only work for two hours. Please don't approach them outside their working hours or ask them to stay after their café hours have ended.
* Even if the tutor is a friend of yours, they have to respect the honor code with respect to CS 230, so don't ask them for help that you wouldn't ask of an instructor.
* One-on-one tutoring is also available for CS230. If you’d like to get some one-on-one tutoring, you can schedule it yourself, on the PLTC website. We will probably check in with you, to schedule a conversation about how you’ve been utilizing the existing resources, and come up with a plan for the future (which can include explicit goals we want the one-on-one sessions to achieve). Scheduled one-on-one sessions that you can no longer attend have to be canceled at least 24h in advance.

**Supplemental Instruction (SI).** SI is an academic support program offered for selected Wellesley courses. Our academic SI leaders are trained and highly experienced in tutoring CS230. They will offer a study session each week throughout the semester. During SI sessions they will cover problem set solutions and review important concepts. SI sessions are open to all students enrolled in the course. We highly recommend attending the SI session every week, as well as reviewing the handouts used in SI sessions.


**Supplemental Instruction (SI) Materials.** The SIs have shared this Google Drive folder of materials with you, so here's a helpful link to the SI documents to make it easier for you to in find it. This folder will include all the handouts they have shared with you in SI.


**Quizzes.** Quizzes are additional learning materials to help you self-check your understanding of each topic. Once you submit a quiz, you will have access to the correct answers and you can re-submit each quiz any number of times.

**Project.** Throughout the semester, project teams of 3-4 students work on an extended programming project from scratch. Your instructors will provide the general description of the project and you will have to write the specifications, and implement it based on the specifications.

**Exams:** There will be two midterms and one final non-collaborative, scheduled exam during exam period. The first midterm exam will be done on paper during a regular class period, and will not require the use of a compiler. The second midterm exam will be take-home and will require the use of a compiler to write and execute your code. The dates of the exams are listed on the schedule. **Please mark the exam dates in your calendars as they are not flexible. The final exam will be at a fixed date and time during the College's exam period: Tuesday, May 7th, from 6pm to 8:30pm:**
* lecture 1: PNE-216
* lecture 2: PNE-327
* lecture 3: PNE-339


<br/>

# Grading Policy

**Class Participation.** Active class participation is expected of every student who wants to succeed in the course, and includes (but is not limited to) attendance, participation in class discussions, and completing lab tasks and quizzes. Please note that if you miss class for any reason, it's your responsibility to obtain the class notes and topics from fellow peers (Courselore can be a resource here!).

**Final Grades.** Your final grade for the course will be computed as a weighted average of several components. The relative weight of each component is shown below:
* Assignments: 15%
* Project: 15%
* First Midterm Exam (in-class): 15%
* Second Midterm Exam (take-home): 15%
* Final Exam (during exam period): 40%

There is **no arbitrary limit** on the number of A's, B's, C's etc., and every student will be assigned the grade they earn and deserve according to the grading standards of the college.

 

<br/>

# Assignments

There will be weekly assignments in which you will write Java programs that emphasize concepts discussed in class. Assignments are an opportunity to delve deeply into topics seen in class, and to answer challenging and complex questions. You may be required to work with a partner on marked task(s) on some of the assignments. Keep in mind that programming often consumes more time than you expect. Start your assignments early! This will give you time to think about the problems and ask questions if you hit an impasse. Assignments are due as indicated on the class schedule.

It is strongly recommended that:
* You start reading the assignment as soon as it becomes available.
* You should not start working on it, however, until you have reviewed the class slides, your notes, the lab exercises, and have resolved your questions by referring to the relevant chapters in the textbook.
* You re-read carefully the assignment and, using paper, pencil and eraser, you sketch the solution.
* Only after you have a reasonable understanding of the assignment and sketched the solution, you start coding on the computer.
* Avoid using online technical sites (such as stack overflow, etc) when you try to code. While they may be rarely useful, they are not geared towards novice programmers and it is more likely that they will confuse you. All of the answers that you need to work on your assignment are in the handouts, the book and the labs.

In other words, we strongly discourage from writing code as soon as you read the assignment, before you read the relevant material and using pen and pencil to sketch a solution. We also strongly discourage from searching the web for solution related to your assignments: using such code would be a violation of the honor code and is likely to lead you to confusion.


**A running program is just the beginning.** A program submitted that runs correctly on a particular input earns only 60% of the total grade. Careful testing that covers both the basic functionality and border cases will earn another 20% of the grade, if the testing is demonstrated. The remaining 20% of the grade is earned for good design that implements OOP, documentation that includes top-of-the-file description, method explanation, and in-line explanation as needed. Good programming style is also expected, including following the CS230 style guide.


**Late Assignment Policy.** Learning programming and data structures is really a sequential process because every new topic builds on the previous. We strongly encourage you to complete your assignment on time, but we know that sometimes this may not be possible.

**For any and all assignments, you could use an automatic 24 hour extension, no need to ask for permission.** However, if that extra day is not sufficient for you to complete the assignment, you are required to contact the instructor and discuss a plan for completing the assignment **before** the assignment is due. We will work together to make sure that plan is a reasonable and effective so that it supports both your learning and your health. **If you do not obtain permission, you can still email your assignment to the instructors for up to one week late for half credit.**


<br/>

# Collaboration Policy

Here is overview on our collaboration policy, and it is followed by a more detailed explanation below:
* Assignments: Pairs of students (when explicitly announced in assignments description).
* Project: Teams of 3-4 students
* Exams: Absolutely no collaboration

We believe that collaboration fosters a healthy and enjoyable educational environment. For this reason, we encourage you to talk with other students about the course material and to form study groups.

Programming assignments in this course can be challenging. Also teamwork and large-scale collaboration is the norm in the CS industry. Given the above, some of the assignment work is required to be done paired with a partner from the class, while some is required to be done individually. In each assignment tasks will be clearly marked as either "individual" or "pair-programming". The two team members must work closely together on the pair-programming tasks, and turn in a single copy of work they did together.


<br/>

# Pair Programming

**Pair-programming tasks are subject to the following ground rules:**
* Each team member has to read the assignment problems, think of how to go on solving it, and sketch some solutions, **before** meeting with their partner.
* While working together, the work must be a true collaboration in which each member of the team will carry their own weight. It is not acceptable for two team members to split the work between them and work independently.
* The fact that team members have to program together means that you need to carefully consider a potential partner's schedule before forming a team. You cannot be an effective team if you cannot find large chunks of time to spend at a computer together!
* Except for the first few assignments that are to be done individually, when submitting an assignment, you have to decide on your partner for the next assignment.
* Working with different partners is a good way to build community in the class. View it as an opportunity.

This semester, the instructors will assign partners for each pair-programming assignment. It is your responsibility to reach out to your partner and arrange times to meet and work on the assignment, keeping in mind the rules above. Sometimes it's hard or impossible to find times to meet, but we expect a good-faith effort.


**Expectations:**
* Contact your partner ASAP
* Make a good-faith effort to work together
  * Doing the same thing at the same time
  * Not divide-and-conquer
* If you visit OH solo, share the hints with your partner. Don't work on the assignment solo.
* Contact us if your partner is not cooperative. (We might be able to re-match you).

In general, teams are allowed to discuss assignment tasks with other teams and exchange ideas about how to solve them. However, there is a thin line between collaboration and plagiarizing the work of others. Please do not cross this line.

**Each team or individual student must compose their own solution to each task.** Discussing strategies and approaches with classmates and receiving general debugging advice from them is acceptable and encouraged. However you (and your partner) are required to write and debug all of your code. Furthermore, you should never look at another student's code. For example, it is OK to borrow code from the textbook, from materials discussed in class, and from other sources as long as you give proper credit. However, it is unacceptable and constitutes a **violation of the Honor Code** (1) to write a program together with someone not part of your team and turn in two copies of the same program, (2) to copy code written by your classmates, (3) to read another student's or team's code (4) to view assignments, exams and solutions from previous terms of CS230, (5) to make any of the assignments, exams and solutions available to others online or off-line, or (6) to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Github Co-pilot or any other language generation model. In keeping with the standards of the scientific community, you must give credit where credit is due (i.e. write their names at the top of the file). If you make use of an idea that was developed by (or jointly with) others, please reference them appropriately in your work. It is unacceptable for students to work together but not to acknowledge each other in their write-ups.

# On using Generative AI tools in CS230

Our policy in CS230 regarding the use of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, or any other) is that it is an honor code violation to use generative AI tools for any purpose related to CS230 material while you complete an assignment or exam for CS230. It is also an honor code violation to copy any code from a generative AI tool and submit it as your work for an assignment or your project. If you use generative AI as part of your learning CS230, you need to be mindful about the following aspects of these tools:
* They can produce incorrect information in a very believable way (known as “hallucinations”), if you take the output of generative AI for its word you might learn incorrect information.
* They are trained on old information and might not have the most up-to-date information that we discuss in class.
* Generative AI is trained on large volumes of data from the Internet and the ethics of its usage and proper attribution to originators is a controversial topic.

**Our Policy.** Use generative AI tools to help your learning, not to avoid learning (cheat). Our CS230 policy is that you cannot use any code from generative AI for class submissions nor use it in any capacity during exams, however we recognize the that these tools can be helpful to assist your learning in other ways and here are our recommendations for using them:
* Ask generative AI to produce questions for you as you study CS230 materials. As stated above, generative AI can produce incorrect solutions so don’t rely on their answers. However, they can produce sample questions and explanations that you can engage with to dive deeper into the course content.
* It will probably produce reasonable answers for very basic concepts about the class material. You can use these tools to answer a simple question about a very common topic and use its answer to complement the way that topic is explained in class and in the textbook.
* Practice asking for help. If you are unsure about what to ask of a TA or instructor, you may start formulating your question with generative AI and come to the CS230 team when you have identified your knowledge gap.



<br/>

# Accessibility and Disability

Every student has a right to full access in this course. If you need any accommodations for CS 230, please contact Wellesley’s Disability Services. You should request accommodations as early as possible during the course, since some situations can require significant time for accommodation design. If you need immediate accommodations, please arrange an appointment with me as soon as possible. If you are unsure but suspect you may have an undocumented need for accommodations, you are encouraged to contact Disability Services. They can provide assistance including screening and referral for assessments. Disability Services can be reached at `disabilityservices@wellesley.edu`, at `781-283-2434`, or by [scheduling an appointment online](https://www.wellesley.edu/disability).



<br/>

# Religious Observance

Students whose religious observances conflict with scheduled course events should contact the instructors in advance to discuss alternative arrangements. You may do this through the [Wellesley College Religious Observance Notification System](https://webapps.wellesley.edu/religious_calendar/) if you prefer.



<br/>
